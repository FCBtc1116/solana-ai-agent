# Solana AI Agent Documentation

Welcome to the **Solana AI Agent** documentation! This Python package provides a powerful toolkit for building AI-powered agents capable of interacting with the Solana blockchain.

## Quick Start

### Installation

To install the package, use the following commands:

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install solana-agentkit

# With development tools
pip install solana-agentkit[dev]

# With documentation tools
pip install solana-agentkit[docs]
```

### Basic Usage

Here’s a simple example to get started with the **SolanaAgent** class:

```python
from solana_agentkit import SolanaAgent

# Initialize the agent with your private key and RPC URL
agent = SolanaAgent(
    private_key="your_private_key",
    rpc_url="your solana rpc url"
)

# Check balance
balance = await agent.get_balance()
print(f"Current balance: {balance} SOL")

# Transfer tokens
result = await agent.transfer(
    to="recipient_address",
    amount=1.0
)
print(f"Transfer successful: {result.signature}")
```
